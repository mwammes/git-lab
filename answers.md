Description: Answers for Lab 2

1. git version 2.17.1
2. The terminal displays the username and email I just established (Meredith Wammes and mw270117@ohio.edu).
3. It pulls up a Git Manual for common commands used and gives a breif despription of them.
4. It displays the status of my repo. It tells me I have no commits and two untraciked files (README.md and answers.md).
 5. I still have no commits made, but README.md is no longer an untracked file and it is ready to be committed. answers.md is still untracked.
6. I no longer have any untracked files. The file names are green (instead of red) meaning they are staged and ready to be committed.
7. Since everything has been committed, our woking tree is clean and there is nothing to commit and no untracked files and nothing staged.
8. The output includes the Hash value, HEAD->master branch indicatory, username, email, date, time, and comment of the commit. Mine looks as such:
commit e37514f087f44b7161fb2c46ec83b2eadd61dfc6 (HEAD -> master)
